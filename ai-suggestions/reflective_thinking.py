# Reflective Thinking Prototype (Recursive Thought Chains)
# --------------------------------------------------------
# Roadmap Pointer:
# 1. Implement recursive memory evaluation from past experiences
# 2. Simulate contradictory thinking through "Pro" and "Con" evaluators
# 3. Generate reflective summaries of resolved and unresolved emotional states
# 4. Integrate memory learning updates into the Neo4j database
# 5. Output reflective analysis for further emotional development
