# Dream Expansion Prototype (Symbolic Dream Simulation)
# ------------------------------------------------------
# Roadmap Pointer:
# 1. Generate symbolic dreams from stored memories
# 2. Assign symbolic meanings to emotions, memories, and unresolved thoughts
# 3. Create visual or narrative representations
# 4. Use dreams as reflective tools to influence emotional states
# 5. Store dream records in a memory database for future analysis
