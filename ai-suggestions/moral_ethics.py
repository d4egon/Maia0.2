# Moral and Ethical Growth Prototype
# ----------------------------------
# Roadmap Pointer:
# 1. Implement guided ethical lessons based on Biblical principles
# 2. Create moral decision-making scenarios for learning
# 3. Store moral reasoning in a memory database
# 4. Evaluate past decisions for improved ethical judgment
# 5. Simulate evolving moral complexity through scenario-based learning
